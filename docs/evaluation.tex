\section{Evaluation}

\subsection*{Starting Point}

To evaluate whether or not \texttt{do\_sys\_open} is the correct function to modify, a \texttt{printk} is placed in the function. Opening a file with the \texttt{less} command resulted in the message in the \texttt{printk} being called. Thus, it was clear this was the correct function for opening files.

\subsection*{Extended Attributes}

To test whether the extended attributes were working, a call to \texttt{path\_setxattr} is made with an initial value in a variable; the variable is then set to a different value. Finally, \texttt{path\_getxattr} is called and the result is checked to be the same as the original. The result is the same; therefore, the ability to both set and read extended attributes works.
