\subsection{Combined Contributions}

Getting getting the ability to set and get extended file attributes was jointly worked, as it was needed for the entire system. Secondly, the logic for restricting the file path was jointly worked on since it too was required to split the subsequent work. Plenty of time was spent discussing multiple ideas, including launching a program when a password was entered incorrectly, giving individual processes ownership over files, and, of course, setting open limits on files. Finally, setting open limits on files was settled upon since it could be learned from to implement process file ownership, and since it appeared to be the most manageable idea to implement.

\subsection{Individual Contributions}
